# Simplified PayPal Web Application
## Design Brief
A secure web application for a local antique dealer named Lovejoy. Lovejoy wants a minimum viable product allowing customers to register and then request evaluations of potential antique objects. Lovejoy has many rivals in the antique business who may sometimes resort to underhand tactics and so is very concerned about the security of the app.
